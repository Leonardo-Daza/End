End Blender Addon

This is the official End addon for blender.  
This addon will allow you to import and export End3D and EndAnim files to/from blender.  
The End3D and EndAnim files are custom file formats that are ASCII based.  
ASCII was chosen as it allows anyone to read the file, making it easy to create import/export scripts for other languages and programs.  
ASCII also ensures that there can never be obfuscation of data within a file, as every part of the data can be interpreted.  
Once a user is familiar with the data structure, they can also verify that the data in an individual file was exported correctly.  
  
To install the add-on, zip the End folder, and add it as an addon with the following steps:  
Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install > Select the zip file  
  
Tested on Blender 3.0.1 and 3.2.1  

The file formats' data structure will be uploaded at a later date.
